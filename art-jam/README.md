## Description

Ari and Soup is an interactive self portrait of myself with soup.

 To pick up the bowl of soup, click on it!

 To set the bowl back down, bring it back to its original spot and click again.

 See what happens if you bring the bowl of soup near my glasses!

 This project is meant to show how it is for me when I try to eat hot soup.
