# Mod Jam Response

## Sounds

To start this off, I really loved the use of sounds by multiple games! I think having sound effects and music playing really added so much to the game, making it feel more alive and engaging. Sound effects broke up the monotony of repetitive actions. The sounds also helped give the games different moods. Some examples of games that really pulled this off were:

The screams of the damned really helped situate yourself in hell and it overall just made the game very funny.

This one felt like those games I used to play in elementary school with my brother. The noises really helped you understand what was happening in the game and provided an extra confirmation of your actions doing something. I knew that when I heard the little pop, it meant I caught the fly. It really gives your actions that extra weight.

Again, like Lanna’s game, this one provided lots of audio feedback that helped understand the game and gave actions more meaning. The clicking sound when changing lanes and the little slurp are great!

All these successful uses of sounds make me want to try something similar out for my next project too. Adding sound effects to the games provides extra feedback to users outside of visual feedback which can help them learn the game faster and make connections between actions and events.

## Frustration

The second thing I noticed when playing these games is that the games I felt people wanted to play over and over again were the games they lost quickly. 
Games that offered a challenge made players want to push themselves and win. That, combined with simple commands, made games that were frustrating but incredibly rewarding if you succeeded. This tends to draw people in.
The greatest example for this is:

This game had every huddled around to see who would be able to survive more than 5 seconds without dying. While each “task” was relatively simple, the combination of everything made the game incredibly challenging. This led to people continuously losing and trying to form strategies such as playing with a friend to divide up the tasks and controls.
It was very funny to see everyone cheer on Kerven for catching 2 flies. 
I think sound also played a big role in this too. The music intensified emotions and made the game feel even more high stakes (if that makes sense).

Speaking of Kerven, his game was also very fun, simply because it's a challenge to last more than 3 seconds.

While the commands are incredibly simple, the game itself is not that simple to win! The fast-pace really made it a challenge (at least to me) so I really enjoyed this game. This game also had great sound design. The music matched the fast-paced game really well and the sudden jumpscare when you lose adds to the frustration felt. The emotional response elicited by losing the game really makes this a memorable experience. 

I think I can learn greatly from this as I tend to overcomplicate things a lot in my projects. I’m not very good at keeping things simple, but these games prove that I don’t need an incredibly complex gimmick to make a game fun, I just need a challenge!
The frustration adds to the fun and makes success all the more sweeter.
