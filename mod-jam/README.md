## Description

This is a modification of the game [FrogFrogFrog](https://pippinbarr.com/frogfrogfrog/).

In this version, Frog is attempting to avoid death by achieving immortality.
To do so, Frog must balance health, wisdom and happiness by eating well, exercising their mind and chatting with friends.

## Rules

To win the game, you must survive for 60 seconds while keeping the meters as high as possible.
[Health](#health-meter) reaching 0 will result in death, but [wisdom](#wisdom-meter) and [happiness](#happiness-meter) can always be raised back up.
Immortality is only achieved with high wisdom and happiness.

### Old Age

As the game advances, Frog will start aging. This will affect not only Frog's appearance but will also make them more vulnerable to things like [back pain](#back-pain) and cataracts.

### Health Meter

Frog's health is pictured as a green meter in the top left corner. It is represented by a green plus symbol.
If this meter reaches 0, Frog will die and it will be game over.
