#Mod Jam ideas

ok so i actually kinda already have my idea but here's extensions to that.
My idea was to make the frog grow old

1.frog gets cataracts
make the screen get yellow-y and add a blur effect/overlay to make it harder to see
2.frog injures its back if you click too fast
old bones just can't keep up
maybe can also apply to quick horizontal movement?
or maybe the frog just gets slowed down for that
3.frog gets wrinkly
and maybe also smaller and a colour change (greyer)
for the visual aspect 
so you can see the changes happen too and understand why certain features are being modified
4.frog will be wise (not sure how to implement this but ok)
gotta have one positive aspect of growing old
maybe a wisdom meter at the bottom
or the frog occasionally says some deep quotes
like: "if you know your enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the results of a thousand battles" or something like that
i think it would be funny to have random art of war quotes mixed in with pop song lyrics or something
5.frog will have dentures (dentures power-up?)
maybe the frog will lose their ability to eat certain flies unless they get dentures?
or the dentures double the nutrition points you get from flies
6.grandkids will visit
an army of frogs can appear as a power up? 
i think frogs have lots of children (like there's usually 1000000 eggs in one big blob)
maybe the grandkids could be tadpoles:)
7.frog complains about the youth
this can work with the wisdom quotes
mix it up a bit
8.frog will remember the good old days
same
give the frog dialogue
or maybe we have some nice flashback cutscenes?
or like a highlight reel of the gameplay when you're done?
like in mariokart
when they show you when your brother threw that red shell at you
causing countless family arguments
9.frog's hearing will get worse
muffle the music and fly noises
maybe have laboured breathing too
but thats one of the sounds that annoys me the most so maybe not
10.frog achieves immortality
possible ending scenario?
maybe if you max out the wisdom meter
11.frog reincarnates
could just be the "play again" button
12.frog learns from past experiences
maybe have the option to undo actions? idk this one's a bit rough to visualize
13.frog puts relish on their toast
this is just my grandpa 
he eats peanut butter toast and relish toast
maybe i can make the frog have weird tastes in food
14.frog struggles to use their iphone
you can tell im running out of good ideas
this is kinda funny though
i could go and play with the actual browser and swith up the controls
to make people feel like they no longer understand technology
15.frog plays card games with their friends
:)
invite other frogs to gossip
possible multiplayer aspect?
16.frog comments on the weather
again, more frog dialog
17.frog tells you to eat more
froggg dialoggg
maybe trigered if you don't catch any flies or miss a certain amount of times
18.frog needs to wath their cholesterol levels
perhaps certain flies will have high sodium while others are healthier
but they taste gross
like my dad's flax seeds (eugh)
19.frog goes to zumba class
dance break
music changes?
perhaps a bonus round or something?
where everything is worth double points?
or maybe this makes you younger
20.frog falls asleep in front of the tv and can never finish a movie
maybe instead we have frog fall asleep after 10 seconds of player inactivity
like an idle animation
